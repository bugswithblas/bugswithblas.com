title: "Web Authentication and Authorization Mechanisms"
description: "This article explores web authentication and authorization mechanisms, covering methods like HTTP Basic, Session-Based, Token-Based (JWT, OAuth, OpenID), OTP, and WebAuthn. It details session management, secure cookie attributes, and key attack vectors such as session hijacking, CSRF, XSS, token leakage, and phishing, with mitigation strategies. Best practices include HTTPS enforcement, MFA, session expiration, token revocation, and least privilege access, making it a valuable resource for developers and security professionals."

## 1. Introduction
- Importance of authentication and authorization in web security
- Overview of modern authentication mechanisms
- Attackers' motivation and common security pitfalls

## 2. Authentication vs Authorization

Authentication and Authorization are two fundamental concepts in security that address different aspects of user access control.

### Authentication: Who Are You?

Authentication is the process of verifying a user's identity. It's essentially the system asking, "Who are you?" When we authenticate, we provide data that allows the system to confirm our identity with certainty. This could involve:

- Entering a username and password
- Using biometric data (fingerprint, facial recognition)
- Providing a security token

### Authorization: What Can You Do?

Once authenticated, authorization comes into play. It determines what actions an authenticated user is permitted to perform within the system. When we try to perform actions like uploading a photo or accessing a specific path, the system asks, "I know who you are, but are you allowed to do this?"

### Key Differences
To summarize the distinction:
- **Authentication** - verifying user identity
- **Authorization** - granting or restricting access


## 3. Types of Authentication

So as we all use webistes and creating accounts, we know that basic type of authentication is providing username and password. Bu underneath of this are many techinques working in the background non visible for the user let's shortly get to know all of them

### 3.1 HTTP Basic Authentication

The simplest one, present firsty in 1992 and is present is http specification since 1996. It's not require login pages, cookies or tokens. All the data are transfered inside header Authorization:

```bash
Authorization: Basic <encoded64(username:password)>
```

Basically server when see the header with word Basic decode value and compare with with database or other provider.


### 3.2 HTTP Digest Authentication

In contrast to the Basic method it use hashing instead of reversiable encoding. The Authentication starts with server sending challenge:

```bash
GET /admin HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
```

```bash
HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized
WWW-Authenticate: Digest realm="Access to the '/' path", nonce="e4549c0548886bc2", algorithm="MD5"
```

```bash
GET /admin HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
Authorization: Digest username="user", realm="Access to the '/' path", nonce="e4549c0548886bc2", uri="/admin", algorithm=MD5, response="6299988bb4f05c0d8ad44295873858cf"

```


### 3.3 Session-Based Authentication
### 3.4 Token-Based Authentication
### 3.5 One Time Passwords (OTP)
### 3.6 OAuth 2.0
### 3.7 OpenID Connect (OIDC)
### 3.8 WebAuthn (FIDO2)
### 3.9 Magic Links

## 4. Session Management
- How Sessions Work
- Server-side vs Client-side Sessions

## 5. Cookies: Security Attributes & Best Practices
- HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite
- Domain & Path
- Max-Age & Expires

## 6. Authentication & Session Attacks
### 6.1 Session Hijacking
### 6.2 Session Fixation
### 6.3 CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery)
### 6.4 XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) & Token Theft
### 6.5 Token Leakage & Replay Attacks
### 6.6 Credential Stuffing
### 6.7 Brute Force Attacks
### 6.8 Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks
### 6.9 Phishing Attacks
### 6.10 OAuth Token Abuse
### 6.11 Session Prediction
### 6.12 API Key Leakage

## 7. Best Practices for Secure Authentication & Authorization
- HTTPS everywhere
- Strong password policies + MFA
- Proper session expiration & token revocation
- Secure cookie attributes
- Monitoring and logging
- Least privilege access control
- Regular security audits and penetration testing

## 8. Implementation Examples
- JWT implementation
- OAuth2 flow
- WebAuthn integration

## 9. Comparison of Authentication Mechanisms
- Table comparing different methods (advantages, disadvantages, use cases)

## 10. Mobile Application Authentication
- Biometric authentication
- Serverless authentication
- Mobile-specific challenges and solutions

## 11. Regulatory Compliance
- GDPR considerations
- PSD2 and Strong Customer Authentication (SCA)

## 12. Authentication in Microservices Architecture
- Challenges in distributed environments

- API gateways and authentication

## 13. Security Testing for Authentication Systems
- Penetration testing methodologies
- Automated security scanning
- Common vulnerabilities to test for

## 14. Real-world Use Cases
- Google's authentication ecosystem
- Facebook's authentication and authorization
- Banking sector authentication practices

## 15. Future Trends in Web Authentication
- Passwordless authentication
- Blockchain-based identity management
- Advancements in WebAuthn and Passkeys

## 16. Conclusion
- Summary of key authentication mechanisms
- Importance of proper implementation
- Balancing security and user experience
