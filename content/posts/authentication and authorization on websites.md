title: "Web Authentication and Authorization Mechanisms"
description: "This article explores web authentication and authorization mechanisms, covering methods like HTTP Basic, Session-Based, Token-Based (JWT, OAuth, OpenID), OTP, and WebAuthn. It details session management, secure cookie attributes, and key attack vectors such as session hijacking, CSRF, XSS, token leakage, and phishing, with mitigation strategies. Best practices include HTTPS enforcement, MFA, session expiration, token revocation, and least privilege access, making it a valuable resource for developers and security professionals."

## 1. Introduction
- Importance of authentication and authorization in web security  
- Overview of modern authentication mechanisms  
- Attackers’ motivation and common security pitfalls  

---

## 2. Authentication vs Authorization
- **Authentication** – verifying user identity  
- **Authorization** – granting or restricting access  
- Differences and their role in web applications  

---

## 3. Types of Authentication
### 3.1 HTTP Basic Authentication
- Sends username and password in base64 encoding in the `Authorization` header
- Simple but insecure if not used over HTTPS

### 3.2 HTTP Digest Authentication
- Uses cryptographic hashing of credentials to improve security over Basic Authentication
- Still vulnerable to replay attacks if nonce values are predictable

### 3.3 Session-Based Authentication
- Uses cookies to maintain authenticated sessions
- Session ID stored on the server and referenced via cookies
- Requires proper session management for security

### 3.4 Token-Based Authentication
- Stateless authentication mechanism
- No need to store session state on the server
- Common implementations include JWT (JSON Web Token)

### 3.5 One Time Passwords (OTP)
- Time-based (TOTP) or HMAC-based (HOTP) passwords
- Used for multi-factor authentication (MFA)
- Common implementations include Google Authenticator, Authy, and SMS-based OTPs

### 3.6 OAuth 2.0
- Authorization framework used for third-party access
- Access tokens & refresh tokens
- Grant types: Authorization Code, Implicit, Client Credentials, Resource Owner Password Credentials

### 3.7 OpenID Connect (OIDC)
- Identity layer on top of OAuth2
- User authentication with identity tokens

### 3.8 WebAuthn (FIDO2)
- Passwordless authentication using public-key cryptography
- Supports hardware security keys (YubiKey, Titan, etc.) and biometric authentication

### 3.9 Magic Links
- Authentication via email-based login links
- Used as a passwordless authentication method

---

## 4. Session Management
- **How Sessions Work**  
  - Stored on the client side (cookies) or server side
  - Used for managing user authentication

---

## 5. Cookies: Security Attributes & Best Practices
- **HttpOnly** – Prevents JavaScript access  
- **Secure** – Only transmitted over HTTPS  
- **SameSite** – Protection against CSRF  
  - None, Lax, Strict  
- **Domain & Path** – Restricts access scope  
- **Max-Age & Expires** – Controlling session duration

## 6. Authentication & Session Attacks
### 6.1 Session Hijacking
- Stealing session tokens (via XSS, MitM, etc.)  
- Preventive measures: HttpOnly, Secure, CSP, HSTS  

### 6.2 Session Fixation
- Forcing a user to use a predefined session ID  
- Mitigation: Regenerate session ID after login  

### 6.3 CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery)
- Exploiting authenticated sessions  
- Mitigation: SameSite cookies, CSRF tokens  

### 6.4 XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) & Token Theft
- Injecting JavaScript to steal authentication tokens  
- Protection: CSP, input sanitization, HttpOnly cookies  

### 6.5 Token Leakage & Replay Attacks
- Exposure of JWT tokens (e.g., in URL, localStorage)  
- Mitigation: Secure storage, short-lived tokens, audience validation  

### 6.6 Credential Stuffing
- Attackers use leaked credentials from data breaches to gain unauthorized access
- Mitigation: Enforce strong password policies, MFA, and login attempt monitoring

### 6.7 Brute Force Attacks
- Repeated attempts to guess passwords or API keys
- Mitigation: Implement rate limiting, account lockout mechanisms, and CAPTCHA

### 6.8 Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks
- Interception of authentication credentials during transmission
- Mitigation: Enforce TLS/SSL, use secure headers (HSTS), and validate certificates

### 6.9 Phishing Attacks
- Social engineering attacks to trick users into revealing authentication credentials
- Mitigation: Use MFA, educate users, and implement phishing-resistant authentication methods

### 6.10 OAuth Token Abuse
- Attackers misuse OAuth access tokens for unauthorized access
- Mitigation: Implement token expiration, scope validation, and secure token storage

### 6.11 Session Prediction
- Guessing valid session IDs to hijack user sessions
- Mitigation: Use cryptographically secure session ID generation

### 6.12 API Key Leakage
- API keys exposed in public repositories, URLs, or client-side scripts
- Mitigation: Store API keys securely, rotate them regularly, and use scopes

## 7. Best Practices for Secure Authentication & Authorization
- Use HTTPS everywhere  
- Enforce strong password policies + MFA  
- Implement proper session expiration & token revocation  
- Use secure cookie attributes  
- Monitor and log authentication activities  
- Implement least privilege access control  
- Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing

## 8. Conclusion
- Summary of key authentication mechanisms  
- Importance of proper implementation to prevent attacks  
- Future trends in web authentication (WebAuthn, Passkeys, etc.)
