Introduction&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>As I was preparing to pass the BSCP exam, the most challenging and unfamiliar type of vulnerability for me was HTTP request smuggling.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To fully understand this attack, it is essential to grasp the fundamentals of the HTTP protocol and how modern web applications are structured, particularly regarding proxy servers, load balancers, and back-end architecture. In this article, I will expand my knowledge by exploring every aspect of this vulnerability.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For someone unfamiliar with this attack, request smuggling exploits discrepancies in how HTTP requests are parsed between front-end and back-end servers. The goal is to manipulate request boundaries, often causing one request to be interpreted as two separate ones. How is this accomplished? Why does this happen? These are the questions I will attempt to answer.&amp;quot;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The impact of request smuggling varies depending on the web application&amp;rsquo;s infrastructure and security controls. In some cases, it can allow an attacker to bypass authentication, access restricted resources, or hijack user sessions—posing a serious security risk.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="2-understanding-core-http-headers-in-request-smuggling">2. Understanding Core HTTP Headers in Request Smuggling&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Before diving into attack techniques, it’s important to understand the headers that play a crucial role in HTTP request parsing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But first, when were these headers introduced, and what problems did they solve? &lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Evolution_of_HTTP#http1.1_%E2%80%93_the_standardized_protocol">HTTP/1.1&lt;/a> was introduced in 1997 to address some of the issues in version 1.0. The main problem with HTTP/1.0 was its inefficiency—each request required a full &lt;strong>3-way handshake&lt;/strong> before it could be processed. Additionally, it lacked built-in support for persistent connections and caching mechanisms. One of the solutions introduced in HTTP/1.1 was the Transfer-Encoding header, which helped improve efficiency in data transmission.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="key-http-headers-relevant-to-request-smuggling">&lt;strong>Key HTTP Headers Relevant to Request Smuggling&lt;/strong>&lt;/h3>
&lt;h4 id="connection-and-keep-alive">&lt;strong>Connection and Keep-Alive&lt;/strong>&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>While the Content-Length and Transfer-Encoding headers specify message lengths, the Connection and Keep-Alive headers allow a connection to remain open for multiple requests, reducing the need for a &lt;strong>3-way handshake&lt;/strong> with every request.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Connection header has two primary options:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>keep-alive&lt;/strong> (default in HTTP/1.1): Keeps the connection open for subsequent requests.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>close&lt;/strong>: Closes the connection after the response is sent.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>The Keep-Alive header specifies the number of requests allowed before the connection is closed and the duration for which an idle connection remains open.&lt;br>
Example:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#272822;background-color:#fafafa;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>Keep-Alive: &lt;span style="color:#111">timeout&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#f92672">=&lt;/span>5, &lt;span style="color:#111">max&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#f92672">=&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#ae81ff">200&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>This means the connection will remain open for up to 5 seconds and allow up to 200 requests before closing.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="content-length">&lt;strong>Content-Length&lt;/strong>&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>What is the format of Content-Length, and why is it used?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>According to &lt;strong>&lt;a href="https://httpwg.org/specs/rfc9110.html#field.content-length">RFC 9110&lt;/a>&lt;/strong>, Content-Length represents the length of the message body as a &lt;strong>decimal, non-negative integer&lt;/strong> (measured in octets).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Why is this necessary?&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>It allows recipients to determine when a message is complete and track its progress.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>One important detail from &lt;strong>&lt;a href="https://httpwg.org/specs/rfc9112.html#body.content-length">RFC 9112&lt;/a>&lt;/strong> states that:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>If a message &lt;strong>does not&lt;/strong> have a Transfer-Encoding header, then Content-Length defines its length.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A sender &lt;strong>MUST NOT&lt;/strong> include a Content-Length header in a message that also contains a Transfer-Encoding header.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h4 id="transfer-encoding">&lt;strong>Transfer-Encoding&lt;/strong>&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>As specified in &lt;strong>&lt;a href="https://httpwg.org/specs/rfc9112.html#field.transfer-encoding">RFC 9112&lt;/a>&lt;/strong>, the Transfer-Encoding header defines how the message body is encoded for transfer. The most common value is &lt;strong>chunked&lt;/strong> encoding.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>How does chunked encoding work?&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>The body is sent in a series of chunks.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Each chunk begins with its &lt;strong>size in hexadecimal&lt;/strong>, followed by the actual data.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A chunk of size 0 signals the end of the message.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>This encoding enables:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Progressive processing&lt;/strong> (recipients can start handling data before receiving the full message).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Dynamic content transmission&lt;/strong> (useful when the final content size is unknown).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Persistent connections&lt;/strong> (keep-alive), improving HTTP efficiency.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="handling-transfer-encoding-and-content-length-in-http">Handling Transfer-Encoding and Content-Length in HTTP&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Even though the specification states that a sender &lt;strong>MUST NOT&lt;/strong> include a Content-Length header in a message that also contains a Transfer-Encoding header, this is not always enforced in practice. This issue was resolved in HTTP/2, where Transfer-Encoding is no longer used.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="what-happens-if-both-headers-are-present-in-a-request">What happens if both headers are present in a request?&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Part &lt;strong>&lt;a href="https://httpwg.org/specs/rfc9112.html#message.body.length">6.3&lt;/a>&lt;/strong> of RFC 9112 discusses a potential attack scenario and provides guidance on handling such cases. Specifically, point 3 states:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>If a message is received with both a Transfer-Encoding and a Content-Length header field, the Transfer-Encoding overrides the Content-Length. Such a message might indicate an attempt to perform request smuggling (Section 11.2) or response splitting (Section 11.1) and ought to be handled as an error. An intermediary that chooses to forward the message MUST first remove the received Content-Length field and process the Transfer-Encoding (as described below) prior to forwarding the message downstream.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Thus, the specification mandates that servers must be aware of both headers. If both are present, the Content-Length header should be removed to prevent misinterpretation.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="why-is-this-a-security-concern">Why is this a security concern?&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>When the HTTP specification was initially created in 1997, infrastructures were simpler, and most websites were handled by a single server. However, modern web architectures rely on multiple components such as proxies, load balancers, and security gateways. Some of these components do not fully support Transfer-Encoding, or they may interpret conflicting headers differently.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This inconsistency in how different servers and intermediaries handle these headers creates an opportunity for &lt;strong>HTTP request smuggling attacks&lt;/strong>. In such attacks, an adversary manipulates headers to cause a server to interpret requests differently from downstream components, potentially leading to security breaches such as cache poisoning, unauthorized request execution, or bypassing authentication mechanisms.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="3-identification">3. Identification&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>At this stage, what do we know? For this vulnerability to occur, multiple servers must be in a request chain, and they must handle headers inconsistently.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The first step is to enumerate proxy servers using tools like traceroute or nslookup. Additionally, the presence of headers like Via or X-Forwarded-For may indicate a multi-hop setup involving proxies or load balancers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Using Burp Suite, the HTTP Request Smuggler extension can automatically send crafted requests to detect vulnerabilities. But what happens under the hood?&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="basic-attack-techniques">&lt;strong>Basic Attack Techniques&lt;/strong>&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Before we proceed, let&amp;rsquo;s go over the three primary types of HTTP request smuggling attacks:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>CL.TE&lt;/strong> (Content-Length vs. Transfer-Encoding mismatch)
The frontend server processes Content-Length (CL), while the backend server processes Transfer-Encoding (TE).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>TE.CL&lt;/strong> (Transfer-Encoding vs. Content-Length mismatch)
The reverse of the above: the frontend processes Transfer-Encoding, while the backend relies on Content-Length.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>TE.TE&lt;/strong> (Two conflicting Transfer-Encoding headers)
Different servers in the chain handle the multiple Transfer-Encoding headers inconsistently.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>There are some prerequisites for identifying these vulnerabilities:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>The attack surface applies only to HTTP/1.1.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;ol start="2">
&lt;li>In Burp Suite, navigate to Repeater, switch the HTTP version to 1.1, and verify whether the request is supported.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;ol start="3">
&lt;li>Enable the option to display non-printable characters. You&amp;rsquo;ll see &lt;code>\r\n&lt;/code> (Carriage Return + Line Feed) at the end of each line. HTTP follows legacy Telnet/MIME standards, where \r\n marks the start of a new line.
An additional \r\n after the headers marks the transition between headers and the request body.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="understanding-chunked-encoding">&lt;strong>Understanding Chunked Encoding&lt;/strong>&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Before testing, it&amp;rsquo;s important to understand the chunked transfer encoding format. According to the HTTP specification, a chunked body is structured as follows:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#272822;background-color:#fafafa;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>chunked-body &lt;span style="color:#f92672">=&lt;/span> *chunk
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> last-chunk
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> trailer-section
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> CRLF
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#111">chunk&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#f92672">=&lt;/span> chunk-size CRLF
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> chunk-data CRLF
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>The chunk size is a hexadecimal value specifying the length of the chunk data.
The trailer section may contain additional headers, but for this test, we will ignore them.
A correctly formatted chunked body looks like this:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#272822;background-color:#fafafa;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>3&lt;span style="color:#8045ff">\r\n&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>abc&lt;span style="color:#8045ff">\r\n&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>0&lt;span style="color:#8045ff">\r\n&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#8045ff">\r\n&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Where first chunk of size 3 sends value &lt;code>abc&lt;/code> and next chunk with size 0 and CRLF at next line tells server that it&amp;rsquo;s last chunk.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now, let’s proceed with testing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Identifying the Vulnerability&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To test for request smuggling, send the following request:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#272822;background-color:#fafafa;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>Content-Length: &lt;span style="color:#ae81ff">6&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>Transfer-Encoding: chunked
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#8045ff">\r\n&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>3&lt;span style="color:#8045ff">\r\n&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>abc&lt;span style="color:#8045ff">\r\n&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>X&lt;span style="color:#8045ff">\r\n&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#8045ff">\r\n&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Here’s what&amp;rsquo;s happening:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The body has 13 bytes, but the Content-Length: 6 header tells the server to expect only 6 bytes.
The presence of X after abc may reveal an inconsistency in how the frontend and backend interpret the request.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Possible Responses&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Immediate rejection: The frontend correctly recognizes Transfer-Encoding: chunked and interprets X as an invalid chunk size (not hexadecimal).This suggests the server correctly processes TE. But we cannot say how backend is reacting. In this situation is either TE.CL or TE.TE&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;ol start="2">
&lt;li>Correct response: This means the frontend and backend both rely on Content-Length, making the application resistant to request smuggling.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;ol start="3">
&lt;li>Timeout: The backend ignores Content-Length, interprets abc as a chunk, but fails on X, as it&amp;rsquo;s not a valid chunk size. The backend waits indefinitely for a valid chunk size, which never arrives. This indicates a TE.CL vulnerability.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Confirming TE.TE vs. TE.CL&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To determine whether the application is vulnerable to TE.TE or TE.CL, send a second request:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#272822;background-color:#fafafa;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>Content-Length: &lt;span style="color:#ae81ff">6&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>Transfer-Encoding: chunked
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#8045ff">\r\n&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>0&lt;span style="color:#8045ff">\r\n&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#8045ff">\r\n&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>X
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>&lt;strong>Possible Responses&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Correct response: This suggests either TE.TE or CL.CL handling.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;ol start="2">
&lt;li>CL.TE behavior: The frontend forwards the entire body, but the backend leaves X in the buffer. If a follow-up request is sent, it may cause an invalid method error like XPOST, showing that X was treated as the beginning of the next request.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;ol start="3">
&lt;li>Timeout: The frontend ignores Content-Length, meaning X is never sent. The backend expects a total body length of 6 but never receives it. This confirms a TE.CL vulnerability.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Automatic Identification&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I showed you how to manually test applications with those two requests. But it&amp;rsquo;s done by the Burp Suite extension &lt;strong>&lt;a href="https://portswigger.net/bappstore/aaaa60ef945341e8a450217a54a11646">HTTP Request Smuggler&lt;/a>&lt;/strong>. To run the extension, right-click on the request and Extensions -&amp;gt; HTTP Request Smuggler -&amp;gt; Smuggle Probe. In the target tab, I got the message:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Possible HTTP Request Smuggling: CL.TE multiCase (delayed response).&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>And in one of the requests below, it&amp;rsquo;s a request similar to those shown above:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#272822;background-color:#fafafa;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>Content-Length: &lt;span style="color:#ae81ff">13&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>tRANSFER-ENCODING: chunked
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#8045ff">\r\n&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>3&lt;span style="color:#8045ff">\r\n&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#111">x&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#f92672">=&lt;/span>y&lt;span style="color:#8045ff">\r\n&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>1&lt;span style="color:#8045ff">\r\n&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>Z&lt;span style="color:#8045ff">\r\n&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>Q&lt;span style="color:#8045ff">\r\n&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#8045ff">\r\n&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>The response from this request is a timeout. Why is it suggesting it&amp;rsquo;s CL.TE? Similar to the previous case, the frontend completely ignores TE, but the backend does not. As it gets Q as a chunk size, it waits for the proper value and responds with a timeout.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#272822;background-color:#fafafa;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>Content-Length: &lt;span style="color:#ae81ff">14&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>tRANSFER-ENCODING: chunked
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#8045ff">\r\n&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>3&lt;span style="color:#8045ff">\r\n&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#111">x&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#f92672">=&lt;/span>y&lt;span style="color:#8045ff">\r\n&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>0&lt;span style="color:#8045ff">\r\n&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#8045ff">\r\n&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>X
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>This time, automatic detection for TE.CL occurs. A very similar approach is used. The frontend ignores X as it uses TE and detects the last chunk. The backend, however, waits for the 14th byte based on the CL value but never receives it, resulting in a timeout.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Detecting TE.TE&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As we showed above, TE.TE can be successfully detected with the first two requests. This situation happens when both the backend and frontend use TE, and we can obfuscate headers to force one of the servers not to process it. As explained on PortSwigger Academy:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Each of these techniques involves a subtle departure from the HTTP specification. Real-world code that implements a protocol specification rarely adheres to it with absolute precision, and it is common for different implementations to tolerate different variations from the specification.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So it&amp;rsquo;s up to the attacker to find subtle differences that allow a header to be ignored. As you can see in the example above from the extension, it uses an obfuscation technique by changing all the characters to uppercase except the first letter: tRANSFER-ENCODING: chunked. The extension tries to perform multiple identifications at once, so it combines multiple techniques into a single request.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are many techniques to obfuscate the TE header. Here are a couple of them:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#272822;background-color:#fafafa;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>Transfer-Encoding: xchunked
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>Transfer-Encoding: x
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>Transfer-Encoding:&lt;span style="color:#f92672">[&lt;/span>tab&lt;span style="color:#f92672">]&lt;/span>chunked
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#f92672">[&lt;/span>space&lt;span style="color:#f92672">]&lt;/span>Transfer-Encoding: chunked
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>X: X&lt;span style="color:#f92672">[&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#8045ff">\n&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#f92672">]&lt;/span>Transfer-Encoding: chunked
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>Transfer-Encoding
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>: chunked
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>Transfer-encoding: identity
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>Transfer-encoding: cow
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>tRANSFER-ENCODING: chunked
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;h2 id="4-http2-request-smuggling">4. HTTP/2 Request Smuggling&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>HTTP/2, while maintaining the same methods, status codes, and headers as its predecessor, fundamentally changes how data is formatted and transmitted. Unlike the text-based HTTP/1, HTTP/2 is a binary protocol, sending data as a collection of 0s and 1s. In the context of request smuggling, it&amp;rsquo;s crucial to note that HTTP/2 doesn&amp;rsquo;t use Transfer-Encoding or Content-Length headers in the same way. Instead, each frame specifies its length in bytes at the beginning, as defined in the HTTP/2 &lt;strong>&lt;a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7540#section-4.1">frame format&lt;/a>&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="http2-downgrading">Http2 downgrading&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The vulnerability of HTTP/2 to request smuggling primarily stems from the process of HTTP/2 downgrading. Many organizations implement this downgrading for backward compatibility with legacy backend systems that haven&amp;rsquo;t yet transitioned to HTTP/2. This flexibility allows administrators to maintain access to older systems while using modern frontend solutions.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, this backward compatibility introduces security risks. When downgrading occurs, the backend loses access to the HTTP/2 frame length value, potentially allowing the injection of HTTP/1 headers.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="h2cl-and-h2te">H2.CL and H2.TE&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>In HTTP/2, requests use pseudo-headers instead of the traditional request line. For example, the path is represented by the :path pseudo-header, and the Host header is replaced by :authority. Here&amp;rsquo;s an example of how an attacker might attempt to smuggle a request:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#272822;background-color:#fafafa;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>:method POST
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>:path /test
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>:authority example.com
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>content-type application/x-www-form-urlencoded
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>transfer-encoding chunked
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#ae81ff">0&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>GET /admin HTTP/1.1
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>Host: example.com
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>Foo: Injected
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>When downgraded to HTTP/1.1, this request might look like:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#272822;background-color:#fafafa;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>POST /test HTTP/1.1
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>Host: example.com
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>Transfer-Encoding: chunked
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#ae81ff">0&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>GET /admin HTTP/1.1
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>Host: example.com
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>Foo: Injected
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>In this scenario, the backend might interpret the body as a zero-length chunk, treating the rest as the beginning of a new request. This could potentially allow access to restricted paths like /admin.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Similarly, an attacker could attempt to inject a Content-Length header:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#272822;background-color:#fafafa;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>:method POST
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>:path /
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>:authority example.com
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>content-type application/x-www-form-urlencoded
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>content-length &lt;span style="color:#ae81ff">0&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>GET /admin HTTP/1.1
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>Host: example.com
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>When downgraded, this becomes:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#272822;background-color:#fafafa;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>POST / HTTP/1.1
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>Host: example.com
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>Content-Length: &lt;span style="color:#ae81ff">0&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>GET /admin HTTP/1.1
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>Host: example.com
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Here, the body of the request might be ignored due to the Content-Length being set to zero, potentially allowing the smuggled request to be processed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are many of possible injections points you can try, there is a great article about it by James Kettle: &lt;strong>&lt;a href="https://portswigger.net/research/http2">HTTP/2: The Sequel is Always Worse&lt;/a>&lt;/strong>. In this article i want to just show basic mechanism.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We’ve established a solid foundation for understanding HTTP request smuggling. We’ve examined essential HTTP headers, analyzed how discrepancies between front-end and back-end processing can introduce vulnerabilities, and explored both manual and automated methods for detecting these issues. A key aspect of this is understanding the role of Content-Length and Transfer-Encoding in request handling.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Understanding HTTP/2 request smuggling requires knowledge of how HTTP/2 differs from HTTP/1, particularly in terms of data formatting and transmission. The vulnerability primarily arises from the downgrading process implemented for backward compatibility. By manipulating headers and taking advantage of how different servers interpret requests, attackers can potentially smuggle requests even in HTTP/2 environments.&lt;/p></description><author>Blazej Gutowski</author><guid>https://bugswithblas.com/posts/understanding-request-smuggling/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 16 Feb 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>How I Became a Burp Suite Certified Practitioner in 2025: Reflections and Tips</title><link>https://bugswithblas.com/posts/bscp-reflections-and-tips/</link><description>&lt;h2 id="introduction">Introduction&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Did you know that the demand for certified cybersecurity professionals is expected to grow by 35% by 2025? Here’s how I navigated the challenges of becoming a Burp Suite Certified Practitioner and what I learned along the way.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="a-bit-about-me">A Bit About Me&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>To provide some context, let me share my background. I have nearly seven years of experience as an IT administrator, where I managed servers, networks, internal websites, and IT infrastructure. This role has given me a solid understanding of how applications and websites function, from the hardware level through servers and firewalls, all the way to the end user. These fundamentals have allowed me to grasp how web applications operate &amp;ldquo;in the background.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Throughout my education and career, I&amp;rsquo;ve also dabbled in coding, working on websites, Android apps, and scripts for internal use. While I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t label myself a programmer, I consider myself a capable code reader. I believe these experiences have provided me with a strong foundation to venture into penetration testing.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="why-this-certification">Why This Certification?&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>At a certain point in my career, I felt the need for change. The &amp;ldquo;programming train&amp;rdquo; wasn&amp;rsquo;t appealing to me, and I found it challenging to build a portfolio that would lead to a well-paying job. Inspired by one of my favorite shows, &lt;em>Mr. Robot&lt;/em>, I decided to take a leap and explore something new. After conducting a brief market reconnaissance, I set my sights on becoming a penetration tester.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In 2023, I began preparing for the OSCP certification but faced setbacks and ultimately didn&amp;rsquo;t pass. However, I decided to take a step back and focus on mastering Burp Suite. But enough about my journey—let&amp;rsquo;s dive into the Burp Suite Exam.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="outline-of-the-article">Outline of the Article&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>In this article, I want to share my experience of passing the Burp Suite Exam. I will provide tips, tricks, and resources that I found helpful along the way, as well as my feelings about the entire process. Whether you&amp;rsquo;re considering this certification or just curious about the world of penetration testing, I hope my insights will be valuable to you.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="preparation">Preparation&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Before diving into the Burp Suite Exam, there are a few essential things you should know. For a comprehensive list of requirements, check out the official &lt;a href="https://portswigger.net/web-security/certification/how-it-works#requirements">PortSwigger certification page&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One crucial detail I initially overlooked was the need for a license for the Pro version of Burp Suite. While most of the requirements are relatively low, you will need to budget $449.00 for the Pro version if you don&amp;rsquo;t already have access to it, plus an additional $99 for the exam. If your current job provides access to Burp Suite, you can use that license. According to PortSwigger:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;If you have a Burp Suite Professional license, but it is registered under an email domain of the company you work for rather than your personal email address, you will still be absolutely fine, from a technical perspective, to use that license for taking the exam. So long as you have access to a valid, active Burp Suite Professional license at the time of your certification, you will be able to use it to take the exam.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>If you have any concerns about using a company-registered license, it&amp;rsquo;s best to discuss this with your employer, as they can provide guidance.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="materials">Materials&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Here are the resources I personally utilized during my preparation:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>PortSwigger Topics and Labs&lt;/strong>: I covered all topics and labs except for the expert level. You can find them &lt;a href="https://portswigger.net/web-security/all-topics">here&lt;/a>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>YouTube Community Solutions&lt;/strong>: I found valuable insights from channels like:
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/@intigriti">Intigriti&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/@netletic">Jarno Timmermans&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>PortSwigger Research Articles&lt;/strong>: These were particularly helpful for understanding concepts like request smuggling. Check them out &lt;a href="https://portswigger.net/research/articles">here&lt;/a>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Botesjuan Repository&lt;/strong>: This is a fantastic resource, especially for learning how to exploit vulnerabilities like XSS to steal cookies rather than just triggering alerts in the browser. You can find it &lt;a href="https://github.com/botesjuan/Burp-Suite-Certified-Practitioner-Exam-Study">here&lt;/a>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Botesjuan YouTube Playlist&lt;/strong>: This &lt;a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLsDxQTEdg_YkVMP6PybE7I-hAdhR7adem&amp;amp;si=1UtLwY27vcw5FGT-">playlist&lt;/a> is a great companion resource, with shoutouts to &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/z3nsh3ll">z3nsh3ll&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/JohnHammond010">John Hammond&lt;/a>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>My Own Site&lt;/strong>: I created a site that mirrors the Botesjuan repository but offers better navigation and includes a section with all payloads. You can visit it &lt;a href="https://oscp-7.gitbook.io/bscp-notes">here&lt;/a>.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="study-methods">Study Methods&lt;/h3>
&lt;h4 id="initial-preparation">Initial Preparation&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>My study approach was straightforward: I completed all topics and labs except for the expert ones. After that, I revisited and retook topics where I felt less confident, utilizing all the materials mentioned above—sometimes reading through them multiple times. I also tackled several mystery labs and completed a practice exam, which I highly recommend to familiarize yourself with the exam format.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="portswigger-methodology">PortSwigger Methodology&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>Following this, I revisited more mystery labs. You can follow the proposed methodology outlined on the PortSwigger website:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Work through the topics within the academy, completing every apprentice and practitioner-level lab as you go. As you reach the end of each topic, use the mystery labs feature to practice solving the labs with no contextual clues. When you&amp;rsquo;ve completed all the practitioner-level labs, practice solving mystery labs from all available topics to develop your recon and discovery skills. Then complete a practice exam to familiarize yourself with the exam format. Make sure to read the exam hints and tips, as they contain invaluable information that you&amp;rsquo;ll need to be successful in the exam.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;h4 id="overcoming-challenges">Overcoming Challenges&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>From my perspective, if a topic seems challenging, revisit it after taking the practice exam and work on it with mystery labs again. This approach helps solidify your understanding and builds confidence in tackling difficult areas.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="time-commitment">Time Commitment&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>I began my preparation in May and passed the exam in January. Throughout this period, I was working full-time and had various personal commitments, including , brithdays, travels and holidays. Therefore, my timeline may not be representative of what others might experience. In hindsight, I believe that 5-6 months is a reasonable timeframe for preparation. However, if you are organized and have more time to dedicate, you could potentially complete it in 3-4 months. Keep in mind that everyone&amp;rsquo;s experience will vary.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="exam-experience">Exam Experience&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The exam consists of two applications that closely resemble those found in the labs. Each application involves three main steps:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Gain access to a standard user account (the username is likely &amp;ldquo;carlos&amp;rdquo;).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Elevate privileges to the administrator account.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Retrieve the contents of the file located at &lt;code>/home/carlos/secret&lt;/code>.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>For more details, you can read about the exam structure &lt;a href="https://portswigger.net/web-security/certification/how-it-works#what-the-exam-involves">here&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The exam duration is four hours.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="my-tips">My Tips&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>I passed the exam on my second attempt and discovered various approaches that can be effective. Here are my recommendations:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Start with Active Scanning&lt;/strong>: Begin by actively scanning both applications simultaneously. This process may take some time, but it’s worth it. As you explore the websites, generate requests and, if you identify any interesting areas, run a scan for specific insertion points or requests.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Utilize Two Screens&lt;/strong>: If possible, set up a dual-screen configuration. Use one larger screen for Burp Suite and the second for your study materials, protocol documentation, and the exam applications. This setup can significantly enhance your workflow.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Be Aware of Obfuscation Techniques&lt;/strong>: Remember that the exam may not present obfuscation techniques in the same straightforward manner as the topics covered in the labs. While most labs utilize basic obfuscation, the exam may require you to employ different techniques. Stay alert and be prepared to adapt your strategies accordingly.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>SQL Injection Automation&lt;/strong>: During my first attempt, I struggled with &lt;strong>SQL injection&lt;/strong>. For the second try I used the &lt;strong>CO2 extension&lt;/strong>, which allows running &lt;strong>sqlmap&lt;/strong> directly in the system terminal. This was a game-changer because it automated the injection process, freeing up my time to focus on other parts of the exam.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Extensions and Tools&lt;/strong> Stick to the tools and techniques covered in the &lt;strong>PortSwigger Academy topics and labs&lt;/strong>. Overcomplicating your approach with unfamiliar tools can waste valuable time. But use some time using it, or use some of newer ones like I used CO for SQL Injection.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;h2 id="reflections">Reflections&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Passing the Burp Suite Exam filled me with a profound sense of accomplishment and relief. The journey was challenging, but it ultimately deepened my passion for penetration testing and web security.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For those preparing for the exam, I want to emphasize that if you find your motivation waning after months or even years due to your current job, remember that achieving such milestones can reignite your drive. If you have doubts, I assure you that the feeling of passing is incredibly rewarding. I can relate to this personally; I created a blog from scratch and wrote this post in just four days. Two months ago, I would have thought that would take me forever.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>In summary, my journey to passing the &lt;a href="https://portswigger.net/web-security/e/c/690adbbe21505dc3">Burp Suite Exam&lt;/a> has been both rewarding and enlightening. The key takeaways from this experience include the importance of thorough preparation, the value of utilizing diverse resources, and the necessity of practicing with real-world scenarios.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Looking ahead, I am eager to deepen my knowledge in the security field. My immediate plan is to gain more experience, hopefully in a new role as a penetration tester, while further developing my skills through CTF platforms and bug bounty programs. I also aspire to attempt the OSCP again and, one day, speak at DEF CON. This professional dream motivates me and provides a boost to my efforts.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Becoming a Burp Suite Certified Practitioner was one of the most challenging yet rewarding experiences of my career. If I can do it, so can you—start your journey today!
